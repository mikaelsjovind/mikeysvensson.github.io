![Merry Christmas](/images/2016-12-21-merry-christmas.jpg)

I created the above christmas card with [Canva](https://appsto.re/se/hfFF1.i). The only export option was PDF but I want my relatives to see the image instantly when receiving their email so I was looking for a way to convert the PDF to a jpg-file. I though the [Workflow](https://appsto.re/se/2IzJ2.i) app could handle it but [apparently not](https://www.reddit.com/r/workflow/comments/3rnpr4/save_pdf_to_photos/) so I came up with my own solution. I looked into my folder of apps related to graphics and there I found [Pixlemator](https://appsto.re/se/lUBh3.i). After exporting the PDF from [Canva](https://appsto.re/se/hfFF1.i) to iCloud drive I could then open it in [Pixlemator](https://appsto.re/se/lUBh3.i) and from there export it to a jpg-file.

Sidenote: The christmas card above was created in the following steps:

1. Gather all your christmas decorations
2. Put the most awesome dogs in the world on top of it
3. Bring out your Fujifilm X-T1 with a XF35/1,4 attached
4. Choose the Asti filmsimulation and set your shutter speed to at lest 1/125 because the dogs are moving
5. Make shoot during daylight because otherwise the lightning is tricky and your ISO will be to high
6. Shoot a least twice the amount of photos you think because the dogs are moving. With two dogs it's twice as tricky
7. Evalute your photos and import the best one into [VSCO](https://appsto.re/se/oegdJ.i) app
8. Apply the A7 preset and bring down it's intensity a notch so the preset won't be to obvious
9. Import the photo to Canva
10. Browse around some templates
11. Make sure the typing aligns with the dogs
12. Export the template and follow the instructions in the above comment
