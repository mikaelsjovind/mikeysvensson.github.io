This post was created with the iOS app [Working Copy - Powerful Git client av Anders Borum](https://appsto.re/se/xONC1.i). Just use your GitHub credentials to checkout your GitHub repository and all the setup is done automatically. Your post is easliy edit with the basic built-in editor. Running Jekyll you can use plain markdown as syntax. 

Working Copy supports keyboard shortcuts so you can use your [Smart Keyboard](http://www.apple.com/smart-keyboard/) without having to reach for the screen to create and publish a new post. 

Next up: Experiment with photos. I'd love to share some of my best photos.
