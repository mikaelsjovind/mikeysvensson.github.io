This post was created with the iOS app [Working Copy](https://appsto.re/se/xONC1.i) - a Powerful Git client by Anders Borum. Just use your GitHub credentials to checkout your GitHub repository and all the setup is done automatically. Your post is easily edit with the basic built-in editor. Running Jekyll you can use markdown as your syntax. 

Working Copy supports keyboard shortcuts so you can use your [Smart Keyboard](http://www.apple.com/smart-keyboard/) without having to reach for the screen to create and publish a new post.
